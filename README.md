## Checkpoints

Checkpoints of the trained models are available in releases.

`segformer-b0` finetuned endpoint can also be found on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/millionhz/segformer-b0-finetuned-flame).

## Installation and inference

- The notebooks will automatically download the self hosted dataset and checkpoints.
- The notebooks themselves are divided into subsections and are self-explanatory.
